# SIH-PROJECT
POST OFFICE SERVICES
In this project, we developed a queue monitoring system for managing counter services in post offices. The system sends an alert notification to the post manager when the number of people in a queue exceeds the specified limit.

Additionally, we designed a post office website that provides detailed information about various post offices and allows users to fill out service forms online.

We also implemented a real-time dashboard that offers visualizations of live data, enabling better decision-making and operational efficiency.
